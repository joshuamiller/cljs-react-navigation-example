# nav-example

To get up and running, you need to:

* Add `cljs-react-navigation` to your `project.clj`
* Add `react-navigation` via `yarn add react-navigation` or `npm i react-navigation`
* Link it to figwheel via `re-natal use-component react-navigation`
* `re-natal use-figwheel`

Then you can run `lein figwheel ios` and `react-native run-ios`.
